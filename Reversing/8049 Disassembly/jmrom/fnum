         Exponent + $81F                                     Mantissa

The exponent is the 12 bit two's complement power of 2 of the number ,the mantissa is the two's
complement fractional part of the number which is then normalised by being shifting left until
the sign bit and the next most significant bit are different. The origonal mantissa part of the
number can always be recreated using this representation by shifting the normalised mantissa
right preserving the sign bit. This explains why the floating point representation of +1 is
$0800400000 and the floating point representation of -1 is $0800800000 which looks bigger.
